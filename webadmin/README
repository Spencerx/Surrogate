Random notes about webadmin, symfony and Doctrine ORM....

This admin system uses Symfony 1.4.8 for it's ORM and admin generators
for layout and templating it uses the 960 grid system for ease of layout and developement
http://960.gs/
The frontend module in symfony is really the admin module. In most other sites you would have the frontend as your 
outside view and then create an "application" called backend then you would access backend.php for all your admin work.

with php 5.2.12 or better (developed with 5.3) you should be able to

php ./symfony cc
mysqladmin create surrogate_webadmin
mysql surrogate_webadmin < surrogate_webadmin.sql

or you can do it all with symfony
php ./symfony cc
php ./symfony project:permissions
php ./symfony doctrine:build --all

Run symfony script by it's self to see all the options, the file surrogate_webadmin is just a dump of mysql
